# anvil-jupyterhub
### An extensions of the default JupyterHub helm chart for the Anvil composable system at Purdue University.

&nbsp;

This chart is based upon the 2.0.0 version of the official JupyterHub helm chart found at [jupyterhub-2.0.0.tgz](https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/jupyterhub-2.0.0.tgz) published at [https://hub.jupyter.org/helm-chart/](https://hub.jupyter.org/helm-chart/).

It adds features and extensions useful for dpeloying JupyterHub for use in an educational setting, and it includes additional files needed to publish the chart as an "app" in the Rancher web-interface for Kubernetes.
